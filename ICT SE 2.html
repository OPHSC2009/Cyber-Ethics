<p id="class2">Cyberethics is a branch of computer technology behavior that defines the best practices that must be adopted by a user when he uses the computer system.
 In simple terms, cyberethics refers to the basic ethics and etiquette that must be followed while using a computer system.
 Ethics, in general, refers to propagating good behavior, similarly by cyber ethics we refer to propagating good behavior online that is not harsh or rude.
 Cyberethics governs rules that individuals must be polite and responsible when they use the internet. Cyberethics aim to protect the moral, financial, social behavior of individuals.
 Cyberethics engages the users to use the internet safely and use technology responsibly and sensibly. Cyberethics empathizes the behavior that must be adopted while using cyber technology.</p>

  <dt>Respect Others</dt>
  <dd>- While there is freedom of speech, it doesn't mean we can turn it into a weapon to say whatever we want. Respect other people's feelings.</dd>
<br><br>
  <dt>Monitor Our Own Speech and Action</dt>
  <dd>-Your speech and action in the cyber-world could cause destruction. Avoid offensive or provocative comments against others online.</dd>
<br><br>
<dt>Think about the Consequences</dt>
<dd>-What we do online could hurt a real person. Our online behaviour could hurt a person or even lead to negative consequences. Though some people might use fake identities in the cyber world, that does not mean we are interacting with a robot.</dd>
<br><br>
<dt>Don’t Misuse Internet for Revenge</dt>
<dd>Some people may go online to take revenge in the cyber world in order to compensate for the unfairness and pain they face in reality. But have you ever thought that it could be a vicious cycle?</dd>
<br><br>
<dt>Don’t Allow Cyberbullying to Continue</dt>
<dd>Don’t always think that cyberbullying is merely an unfortunate incident you come across and take no action. Do not let cyberbullying continue and go unnoticed.</dd>
